## September 2021

Culture:

- Reading Iain Banks' [_The Crow Road_](https://www.librarything.com/work/40571)
  as part of my mission to read more of his non-sci-fi work.

- Recently read Colson Whitehead's [_The Nickel Boys_](https://www.librarything.com/work/22589660) and Margaret Atwood's
  [_The Testaments_](https://www.librarything.com/work/22568688); both of which are excellent.

- Haven't watched much TV in recent months. Haven't even finished _Band of Brothers_ yet but am also part way
  through _Fargo: Season 4_ and _White Lotus_.

- Haven't been to the cinema this year.

- Gaming: still only about 40% through _Assassin's Creed: Valhalla_.

## May 2021

Culture:

- Reading William Gibson's [_Pattern Recognition_](https://www.librarything.com/work/610). Have recently
  finished two excellent books: Douglas Stuart's [_Shuggie Bain_](https://www.librarything.com/work/23737379) and
  Grace Dent's [_Hungry_](https://www.librarything.com/work/25666405).

- Still plodding through _Band of Brothers_. Recently enjoyed [_The Terror_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0954ks6/the-terror) and
  Netflix's [_Suburra_](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80081537).

- Am playing _Watchdogs: Legion_ and _Assassin's Creed: Valhalla_ when I get the
  chance.

Life:

- Starting getting back into bouldering.

- Am hoping to start playing cricket again at Enfield Cricket Club.


## January 2021

Culture:

- Reading Zadie Smith's [_White Teeth_](http://www.librarything.com/work/5183)
  as part of an attempt to avoid exclusively reading books by white men.

- Haven't finished any of the series mentioned in November update but have also
  started _Mindhunter season 2_ and _The Queen's Gambit_.

- Speaking of chess, I highly recommend [Daniel Naroditsky's "speed run" YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytkf3qZTj74&list=PLT1F2nOxLHOcmi_qi1BbY6axf5xLFEcit&ab_channel=DanielNaroditsky), which I'm working my way through.

Life:

- Doing a lot of lockdown runs; am trying to get my running time below 4:30 per km â€” [am getting closer](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31709197).


## November 2020

Culture:

- Reading Ian Dunt's [_How to be a liberal_](https://www.canburypress.com/products/how-to-be-a-liberal-by-ian-dunt-hardback-isbn9781912454419), which I'm enjoying greatly.

- Watching _Schitt's Creek_ with Katy and juggling _Gomorrah Season 3_, _Band of Brothers_ and
  _Dark Season 1_ on my own.

- Not started any new podcasts for a while --- am listening to old favourites like
  _Guardian: Today in Focus_, _Athletico Mince_, _Desert Island Discs_ and _The
  Economist_.

- Still working my way through _Red Dead Redemption_ on an old Xbox 360. Looking
  forward to getting a Series X later this year and playing something more
  modern than 2010.

Life:

- Gutted that the second UK lockdown is forcing [Stronghold](https://www.thestrongholduk.com/) to close its doors for an unknown period.
