- Seen lot of series over recent months but only _Severance_ and _The
  Underground Railroad_ stand out.

- Am working my way through the entire back catalogue of _The Rest is History_
  podcast. Have listened back to around episode 180 so still quite a few to go.

Life:

## July 2022

Culture:

- Read so far this year:

  - _The Sellout_ by Paul Beatty
  - _Maus_ by Art Siegelman
  - _Girl, Woman, Other_ by Bernardine Evaristo
  - _Masters of Doom_ by David Kushner
  - _How to be a woman_ by Caitlin Moran
  - _The Colour_ by Rose Tremain
  - _Bring up the Bodies_ by Hilary Mantel

  Reading Booker prize winners is still paying dividends.

- Recently finished the first season of _Gomorrah_ plus the accompanying
  _L'Immortal._ — really enjoyed it all. Nothing beats _Better Call Saul_
  though.

- Have stumbled upon some good French music on Spotify. Artists like _Lewis
  OfMan_, _Blue Toucan_, _Papooz_, _Polo and Pan_ — always good when you find a
  rich vein of new music.

Life:

- Surprising broke my 5k PB the other day by running 21:31 in a local Park Run.

## September 2021

Culture:

- Reading Iain Banks' [_The Crow Road_](https://www.librarything.com/work/40571)
  as part of my mission to read more of his non-sci-fi work.

  [_The Nickel Boys_](https://www.librarything.com/work/22589660) and Margaret
  Atwood's [_The Testaments_](https://www.librarything.com/work/22568688); both
  of which are excellent.

  Brothers_ yet but am also part way through _Fargo: Season 4_ and _White
  Lotus_.

- Haven't been to the cinema this year.

- Gaming: still only about 40% through _Assassin's Creed: Valhalla_.

Life:

## May 2021

Culture:

- Reading William Gibson's
  [_Pattern Recognition_](https://www.librarything.com/work/610). Have recently
  finished two excellent books: Douglas Stuart's

  chance.

Life:

## January 2021

Culture:

- Reading Zadie Smith's [_White Teeth_](http://www.librarything.com/work/5183)
  as part of an attempt to avoid exclusively reading books by white men.

- Haven't finished any of the series mentioned in November update but have also
  started _Mindhunter season 2_ and _The Queen's Gambit_.

- Speaking of chess, I highly recommend
  [Daniel Naroditsky's "speed run" YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytkf3qZTj74&list=PLT1F2nOxLHOcmi_qi1BbY6axf5xLFEcit&ab_channel=DanielNaroditsky),
  which I'm working my way through.

Life:

- Doing a lot of lockdown runs; am trying to get my running time below 4:30 per
  km — [am getting closer](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31709197).

## November 2020

Culture:

- Reading Ian Dunt's
  [_How to be a liberal_](https://www.canburypress.com/products/how-to-be-a-liberal-by-ian-dunt-hardback-isbn9781912454419),
  which I'm enjoying greatly.

- Watching _Schitt's Creek_ with Katy and juggling _Gomorrah Season 3_, _Band of
  Brothers_ and _Dark Season 1_ on my own.

- Not started any new podcasts for a while --- am listening to old favourites
  like _Guardian: Today in Focus_, _Athletico Mince_, _Desert Island Discs_ and
  _The Economist_.

- Still working my way through _Red Dead Redemption_ on an old Xbox 360. Looking
  forward to getting a Series X later this year and playing something more
  modern than 2010.

Life:

- Gutted that the second UK lockdown is forcing
  [Stronghold](https://www.thestrongholduk.com/) to close its doors for an
  unknown period.
