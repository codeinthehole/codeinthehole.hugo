Hello, I'm **David**, a software engineer.

## Employment

I'm **Head of Software Engineering** at
[Kraken Technologies](https://kraken.tech/), the technology part of
[Octopus Energy Group](https://octopusenergy.group/). I help run a
[department of engineers](https://tech.octopus.energy) building the "Kraken"
software platform that underpins the business.

Octopus Energy became the 15th UK tech
["unicorn"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)>) in May 2020,
after
[investment from Origin Energy](https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-energy-achieves-unicorn-status-investment-origin-energy/).

Previously I've worked as:

- **Director of Engineering** at [Yoyo Wallet](http://yoyowallet.com/), a
  payments and loyalty start-up;
- a **Technical Director** (and various other roles) at
  [Tangent Snowball](http://www.tangent.co.uk/), a digital agency;
- an **Operational Researcher** at
  [HM Revenue and Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs).

One of my strengths is building and running teams that write high-quality,
maintainable software.

## Interests

_Everything_ to do with software; but especially:

- Design, patterns and architecture.
- Tests, testing and TDD (I'm a keen advocate of
  [London-school TDD](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/London-school-TDD)
  and
  [Discovery testing](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Discovery-Testing)).
- [Vim](/tags/vim/), [Git](/tags/git/), and working at the command-line (I
  originally wrote the site [commandlinefu.com](http://www.commandlinefu.com)).
- [Python](/tags/python/), [Javascript](/tags/javascript/), Golang.
- [AWS](/tags/aws/), the "Hashistack", infrastructure-as-code.
- The practices of effective teams: code review, continuous deployment, pairing
  etc
