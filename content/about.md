Hello, I'm **David**, a software engineer.

## Employment

I'm **Head of Engineering** at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy), a tech-focussed UK energy
supplier. I help run a [team of engineers](https://tech.octopus.energy) building the "Kraken" software platform that underpins the
business. Octopus Energy became the 15th UK tech ["unicorn"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)) in May 2020,
after [investment from Origin Energy](https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-energy-achieves-unicorn-status-investment-origin-energy/).

Previously I've worked as:

- **Director of Engineering** at [Yoyo Wallet](http://yoyowallet.com/), a payments
and loyalty start-up;
- a **Technical Director** (and various other roles) at [Tangent Snowball](http://www.tangent.co.uk/), a digital agency;
- an **Operational Researcher** at [HM Revenue and Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs).

One of my strengths is building and running teams that write high-quality, maintainable software.

## Interests

_Everything_ to do with software; but especially:

- Design, patterns and architecture.
- Tests, testing and TDD (I'm a keen advocate of [London-school TDD](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/London-school-TDD)
 and [Discovery testing](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Discovery-Testing)).
- Unix, Bash and working at the command-line (I originally wrote the site
    [commandlinefu.com](http://www.commandlinefu.com)).
- [Python](/tags/python/), [Javascript](/tags/javascript/), Golang.
- [Vim](/tags/vim/), [Git](/tags/git/).
- [AWS](/tags/aws/), the "Hashistack", infrastructure-as-code.
- The practices of effective teams: code review, continuous deployment, pairing etc
