From the final novella of David Mitchell's [_The Bone
Clocks_][wiki_bone_clocks], set in Ireland in 2043:

> 'Number one is to survive', answers Hood, watching the men on the roof.
> 'They're all dead, like my parents. They had a better life than I did, mind.
> So did you. Your power stations, your cars, your creature comforts. Well, you
> lived too long. The bill's due. Today,' up on the roof the bold is cut on the
> first panel, 'you start to pay. Think of us as the bailiffs.'
>
> 'But it wasn't us, personally, who trashed the world,' says Mo. 'It was the
> system. We can't change it.'
>
> 'Then it's not us, personally, taking your panels,' says Hood. 'It's the
> system. We can't change it.'

This part of the book is a dark but plausible imagining of what life might be
like if we fail to halt climate change. The modern world has collapsed into
violence following a huge depletion of resources, and many people are forced to
live off the land again.

It feels like a description of how we end up in the world of Cormac McCarthy's
[_The Road_][wiki_road].
