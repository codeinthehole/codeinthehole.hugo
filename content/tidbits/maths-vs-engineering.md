[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)
is full of interesting footnotes. Here's a good one about the Fermat test for
prime numbers:

> Numbers that fool the Fermat test are called _Carmichael numbers_, and little
> is known about them other than that they are extremely rare. There 255
> Carmichael below 100,000,000. The smallest few are 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821
> and 6601. In testing primality of very large numbers chosen at random, the
> chance of stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is less than the
> chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make an error in
> carrying out a correct algorithm. Considering an algorithm to be inadequate
> for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the difference between
> mathematics and engineering.
