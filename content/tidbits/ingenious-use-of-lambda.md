Just stumbled across a gem of a question whilst idly browsing [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/):

> Design a function `f`, such that: `f(f(n)) == -n` where `n` is a
> 32-bit signed integer; you can't use complex numbers arithmetic.

Interesting in its own right, what makes this particularly intriguing is
that the question doesn't specify a language to use - indeed, the choice
of language has a major say in the range of solutions available. The
following solution in Python is stunningly elegant:

``` python
def f(x):
    if isinstance(x, int):
        return (lambda: -x)
    else:
        return x()
```

The use of a lambda function is very clever but does feel like cheating
a little. Nevertheless, such a solution was a sharp reminder of the
dangers of being too versed in a particular language (PHP in my case)
such that it's hard to think outside the language constraints. Of
course, the above solution can be implemented in any language that
supports anonymous functions.

The less clever but more "natural" solution (at least to a
mathematician) is for `f` to toggle the parity of `n`, multiplying by -1
only for one parity (the cases of positive and negative n need handling
separately). It's fairly easy to build up the solution by considering in
sequence `n=0,1,2,3,...` - see the following clunky PHP implementation:

``` python
function f($n)
{
    if (0 == $n) return 0;
    if ($n > 0) {
        return ($n % 2 == 1) ? $n + 1 : 1 - $n;
    } else {
        return ($n % 2 == 1) ? $n - 1 : -($n + 1);
    }
}
```
