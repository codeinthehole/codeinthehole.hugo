Last Wednesday was my last day at Yoyo Wallet. Thursday marked my first day at
Octopus Energy.

I'm deeply excited about Octopus. Through innovative use of technology,
especially automation and cloud computing, Octopus Energy is going to radically
change how people consume and pay for energy in the UK. We're going to be both
cheaper and massively better at customer service than the much-maligned
incumbents.

Right now,
[we're looking to build a superb tech team](http://tech.octopus.energy/news/2015/11/23/tech-jobs.html).
Get in touch if you're looking for a challenge and would like to play a
formative part in a company that's genuinely making the world a better place, in
helping transition the UK to a lower carbon future.
