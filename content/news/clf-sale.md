For the record, I no longer maintain
[commandlinefu.com](http://www.commandlinefu.com/). I've handed over the baton
to notable Bay Area celebrity, Jon Hendren ([@fart](https://twitter.com/fart)).
This is a good thing for the site and its users as I have been unable to do much
maintenance in recent times. I look forward to seeing how the site evolves.
