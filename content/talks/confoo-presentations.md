I gave two presentations at Confoo 2012 - below are the abstracts and
slides.

### Migrating from PHP to Python and Django

Abstract:

> Many programmers cut their teeth with PHP before getting interested in
> Python. However, while the languages seem similar at first, there are
> many new concepts to grasp and a rich ecosystem of tools to master.
> This isn't easy, but with the right advice, a strong PHP developer can
> become an excellent Python developer very quickly.
>
> Based on the experience of migrating a development team from PHP to
> Python and Django, this talk will examine how to tackle this journey.
> While the fundamental languages differences will be touched upon, this
> talk will focus on more interesting topics such as common python
> gotchas, tips for grokking Django, awesome tools and applications from
> the community, and how to manage such a migration for a large team of
> developers.

### Writing a Django e-commerce framework

Abstract:

> Django is well-suited for e-commerce, and there are currently several
> nascent django e-commerce frameworks in development. This talk is
> about the development of django-oscar, a framework designed to
> leverage Django's core functionality to allow domain-driven e-commerce
> applications to be built. This is a very powerful approach.
>
> Writing django apps which are flexible enough to be adapted to a wide
> variety of scenarios is a non-trivial problem which will be explored.
> The talk will also cover a range of e-commerce best practices and how
> they can be implemented in Django.
