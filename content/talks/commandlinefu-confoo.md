The presentation I gave at [Confoo 2011](http://confoo.ca/en) is now
[available online](http://presentations.codeinthehole.com/confoo2011/), there is
feedback on [joind.in](http://joind.in/talk/view/2896).

The slides are written in [Eric Meyer's S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/),
which is a XHTML, CSS and Javascript based slide show format. I enjoyed using
this as it was easy to port my styles across from the website CSS file, it also
means the presentation is viewable as a normal webpage (no flash required).
However, the downside is that it is not easy to submit the slides to Slideshare
which is the common thing to do. There are a few work-arounds out there but
nothing good enough that I could find.
