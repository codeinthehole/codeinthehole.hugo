High Performance Web Sites (HPWS) is essentially a book-length exposition of the
[YSlow extension to Firebug](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) augmented with
case studies of popular US websites. YSlow itself links to some
[explanation paragraphs](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html)
regarding the various guidelines that are used to grade the performance of a
website. However, even for those familiar with this documentation, HPWS is still
an excellent resource on how the performance of a web app can be tuned.

Chapter by chapter, HPWS introduces a new guideline and expounds the underlying
rationale, giving illustrations of the HTTP requests with and without the
suggested improvement. For instance, the use of far-future Expires HTTP headers
is an easy-win recommendation that prevents unnecessary requests once a
browser's cache has been primed. This is something I've used on several sites
previously, employing the following Apache directives to add Expires headers to
the HTTP:

```apache
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType image/jpg “access plus 2 years”
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg “access plus 2 years”
    ExpiresByType image/gif “access plus 2 years”
    ExpiresByType text/css “access plus 2 days”
    ExpiresByType image/js “access plus 2 days”
    ExpiresDefault ”access plus 1 days”
</IfModule>
```

Additional areas where I found out something new include:

- The performance hit that using @import directives within CSS files has.
- How the "Cache control" and "Etags" HTTP headers are often interpreted
  together by browsers to determine whether to make a request.
- How the choice of domains to use for serving content must be balanced against
  the extra DNS look-up costs that each new domain incurs.

Many of the performance guidelines can be adhered to easily, by making a few
adjustments to the Apache configuration of your site; However, some
performance-enhancing measures come at a cost to the development process (such
as keeping all javascript in one large, minified file). Such costs can be
mitigated by having a careful one-step build process that handles the conversion
of easy-to-use development files to more performance-savvy production files.
Nevertheless, in many cases, one has to decide where the balance between
performance and inconvenience in development lies.

It's quite a short book at 137 pages, but definitely a worthwhile addition to
any company library.
