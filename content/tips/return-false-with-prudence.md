From "Javascript: the good parts":

> It is rarely possible for standards comittees to remove imperfections from a

> except heap more features on top of the existing pile of imperfections.

Douglas Crockford's terse yet lucid javascript primer makes some excellent
points on writing in a language with more than its fair of share of
shortcomings. The advice is manyfold: constituting functionality or design
decisions to avoid (the "bad" and "awful" parts) as well as patterns and
practices making use of the strongest parts of the language. Essentially, one is
guided to programming within a subset of the language, avoiding the poor quality
and outright dangerous components. This chimes in well with the notation of
"programming _into_ a language" rather than within in it - stressed by the
seminal "Code Complete" by Steve McConnell.

Both these concepts are relevant to programmers of PHP - a language carrying
just as much baggage as javascript. In my experience, developers who have only
known PHP are prone to employing of a variety of bad practices and
anti-patterns. Such things are fostered by several influences, including the
forgiving nature of the language, the veritable wealth of bad advice within the
comments on the PHP manual, and a general lack of understanding of the art of
object-oriented programming. Indeed, I think it's essential that PHP developers
learn to program (and hence _think_) in other languages: python and java in
particular. Reading the work of Martin Fowler is a good place to start but
that's a topic for another time.

One irritating programming idiom -- especially common to PHP programmers -- is
to use a return value of `FALSE` to indicate that something has gone wrong, or
that no valid return value could be found. Unless the only other possible return
value is `TRUE`, this is almost always wrong.

Of course, many programmers pick up this nasty habit from the PHP standard
library itself, which employs this practice frequently. Further, it is similar
to the C and UNIX convention of returning non-zero values as error codes (and
sometimes vice-versa). The language writers of PHP have the excuse that this was
the only mechanism available back in the dark days of PHP before version 5,
before the introduction of exceptions - programmers coding today do not have
that excuse. Indeed, employing this technique betrays a lack of understanding of
what it means to program into a language rather than within it.

Instead, please consider doing one of the following:

### Throw an exception

When an error has occurred, a thrown exception is a clean and intent-revealing
means of handing control over to a component of your program that can deal with
the error. This saves cluttering up the normal execution path with checks for
error codes and generally leads to concise and readable code. This leads to
shorter, cleaner methods and allows the use of fluent interfaces - safe in the
knowledge that a valid object will always be returned.

So use:

```php
<?php
try {
    // Place an order
    $orderNumber = $this->generateNewOrderNumber();
    $this->saveDeliveryAddress()
        ->saveBillingAddress()
        ->saveBatches()
        ->saveOrder($orderNumber);
} catch (OrderCreationException $e) {
    // Rollback transaction, return friendly error message
}
```

instead of

```php
<?php
$orderNumber = $this->generateNewOrderNumber();
if (!$orderNumber) return false;
$deliveryAddressSavedOk = $this->saveDeliveryAddress();
if (!$deliveryAddressSavedOk) return false;
$billingAddressSavedOk = $this->saveDeliveryAddress();
if (!$billingAddressSavedOk) return false;
...
```

Using exceptions to indicate errors obeys the Command-query separation
principle, where (broadly speaking) only "getter" methods should return a value
(using fluent interfaces is a mild but acceptable violation of this separation).

### Return `null`, Null object or an empty collection

Many objects will employ "finder" or factory methods responsible for looking up
and then constructing an object:

```php
<?php
$book = Book::findByIsbn($isbn);
```

In this case, when no book is found, FALSE is not the appropriate return value -
either return NULL (to indicate the absence of a valid book), or employ the Null
Object pattern and return an null book object. It just feels so wrong returning
multiple types from a function. Alarm bells should ring as soon as you see the
pipe:

```php
<?php
/**
* @param string $isbn
* @return Book|false
*/
```

A neat idiom for finder methods is to always return a iterable collection of
objects, which is simply empty when no object is found:

```php
<?php
class Book
{
    ...
    public static function findByIsbn($isbn)
    {
        $books =  new BookCollection; // An iterable collection object
        ...
        // Loop through database result set and add books to BookCollection
        ...
        return $books;
    }
}
```

Client code can then simply iterate over the returned value - it doesn't have to
check for the presence of an item. JQuery employs this pattern extensively with
its `$` CSS selector and it works wonderfully. The only downside for this is
mental discomfort involved in selecting an element where there can only ever be
one: such as an element with a unique id (`$('#my_element')`).

Ultimately, there's only really one place where returning false is appropriate:
that's in a method that only returns boolean values.
