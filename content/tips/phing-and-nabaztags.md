Finally got around to setting up continuous integration for some of the projects
that comprise the day-job. We're using the PEAR package Xinc, which has proved
to be excellent thus far - especially as it integrates so well with my
deployment tool of choice: Phing. Part of the fun in setting it up was looking
for suitable feedback mechanisms or devices. Email notifications are a given but
there are a range of more interesting feedback mechanisms available such as
toolbar notifications, remote-controlled lava lamps, or plain humiliation
tactics (such as making the person who broke the build wear the dunce's hat till
it is fixed). By a strange twist of fate there happened to be an unused Nabaztag
in the office: a strange Rabbit-like fellow able to play sounds, move its ears
and activate a selection of brightly colours LEDs contained in its body.
Nabaztags are controlled through a simple HTTP web-service, with the various
actions been specified by GET requests using a simple API.

Out of the box, Xinc only provides email notifications for feedback but its
design is such that plugins are easy to create. Indeed, Raphael Stolt has
written recently on creating a publisher that uses the Growl notifications
native to Macs. A natural extension to this would be to create an Linux version,
given the inclusion of libnotify in the latest Ubuntu release. That's not for
today though.

The true flexibility in Xinc comes from the phingpublisher publisher, which
allows an arbitrary target to be called from a phing script. Rather than create
a Xinc plugin for the Nabaztag, writing a Phing task seemed to offer more
flexibility as it could then be used in deployment scripts elsewhere.

I've previously created a couple of simple phing tasks for updating a Twitter
status, and interacting with the Unfuddle API. Creating a Nabaztag task was just
a simple extension of these cURL-based tasks. The various attributes mirror
those from the API docs.

  messageId           Integer   Message id.                                         n/a       No
  voice               Integer   Voice to use (use the API to fetch the full list)   n/a       No
  choreography        String    A string which prescribes the choreography
                                to use (see API docs)                               n/a       No
  choreographyTitle   Boolean   Choreography title                                  n/a       No
  urlList             Boolean   List of URLs to pass to the Nabaztag (can be
                                used for playing audio files)                       n/a       No
  checkReturn         Boolean   Whether to check the return code of the request,
                                throws a BuildException if the update fails         false     No
```

The code for this task can be found in my github repo - to install locally,
export the file to a local phing tasks folder (I use
`/usr/share/php/phing/tasks/my` on my Ubuntu machine). Having done that, a
simple example build.xml file to exercise the task would be:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<project name="Example Nabaztag update" basedir=".">
    <taskdef name="nabaztag" classname="phing.tasks.my.NabaztagTask" />
    <target name="build-failure">
        <nabaztag serialNum="${nabaztag.serialNum}" token="${nabaztag.token}" message="The build failed!" voice="US-Liberty" />
    </target>
</project>
```

To use this with Xinc, you simply need to called the appropriate target from
your project configuration file. Another toy example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xinc>
    <project name="Toy example">
        <configuration>
                <setting name="loglevel" value="1"/>
                <setting name="timezone" value="Europe/London"/>
        </configuration>
        <property name="dir" value="/var/xinc/projects/sample"/>
        <cron timer="*/15 * * * *"/>
        <modificationset>
            <svn directory="${dir}" update="true" />
        </modificationset>
        <builders>
                <phingBuilder buildfile="${dir}/build.xml" target="build-project"/>
        </builders>
        <publishers>
            <onfailure>
                <phingpublisher buildfile="${dir}/build.xml" target="build-failure" />
            </onfailure>
        </publishers>
    </project>
</xinc>
```

Some of the options for controlling the Nabaztag are only available with the V2
version. The one on my desk is V1 and so I haven't tested every action, I've
just followed the instructions in the API docs. Unfortunately, the Nabaztag
webservice isn't as RESTful as would be desired - it returns a 200 response code
for every request, whether it fails or not. This makes it a touch tricky to
handle failed updates.

Nabaztags are also useful for general reminders - I have the following line in
my crontab:

```bash
15 18 * * 5 curl "http://api.nabaztag.com/vl/FR/api.jsp?sn=$SERIAL&token=$TOKEN&tts=It+is+now+time+to+go+to+the+pub"
```
