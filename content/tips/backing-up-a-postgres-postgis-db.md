I wasted at least twenty minutes getting this to work. These are my
notes.

### Problem

You are using a PostGIS database and want to take a backup copy from
production and restore it in a different environment. One complication
is that each environment connects to its database with its own user.

This is a common scenario if you are using
[GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/).

### Solution

Suppose your production database is called "myproject\_prod" which you
connect to with user "myproject\_prod\_role" and you want to replace
your existing stage database "myproject\_stage" that you connect to with
user "myproject\_stage\_role".

First, dump your production database:

``` bash
pg_dump --no-acl --no-owner $DATABASE > dump.sql
```

where:

- access control is ignored (`--no-acl`) as your production database
    may have additional users that you're not interested in;
- ownership is ignored (`--no-owner`) as you will be restoring as a
    different user.

Now, copy the SQL file across to the appropriate server and create the
destination database from a PostGIS template with the appropriate owner:

``` postgres
postgres=# DROP DATABASE myproject_stage;
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE myproject_stage TEMPLATE template_postgis OWNER myproject_role_stage;
```

and restore the database using the stage user:

``` bash
psql --host=127.0.0.1 --username=myproject_role_stage myproject_stage < dump.sql
```

Be warned: this command will generated a lot of warnings (which can be
ignored). This happens as `pg_dump` generates SQL relative to the
'template0' database (not 'template\_postgis' which would be more
helpful in this situation). Thus, the dumped SQL file contains the
definitions of PostGIS types which have already been defined when we
created the database from "template\_postgis".

<div class="admonition note">
    The host is specified in the restore operation (<code>--host=127.0.0.1</code>) so
    as to trigger the correct authentication rules from <code>pg_hba.conf</code>. I
    usually forget this and am confused about why I can't authenticate. You
    might not need this if your authentication config is different.
