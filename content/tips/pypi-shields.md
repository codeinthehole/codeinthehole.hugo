Thanks to [@kuramanga](https://twitter.com/kuramanga), it's now possible
to add shiny PyPi badges to your Python project READMEs that indicate
the latest released version on PyPI and the total number of downloads.

This screenshot is taken from
[django-oscar](https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar)'s README.

Embed these badges in your own repo as Restructured text:

``` rst
.. image:: https://pypip.in/v/$REPO/badge.png
    :target: https://crate.io/packages/$REPO/
    :alt: Latest PyPI version

.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/$REPO/badge.png
    :target: https://crate.io/packages/$REPO/
    :alt: Number of PyPI downloads
```

or Markdown:

```markdown
[![PyPi version](https://pypip.in/v/$REPO/badge.png)](https://crate.io/packages/$REPO/)
[![PyPi downloads](https://pypip.in/d/$REPO/badge.png)](https://crate.io/packages/$REPO/)
```
