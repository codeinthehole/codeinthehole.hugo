On code smells:

- If your codebase is tightly coupled to data in your database (ie the codebase
  has a data value hard-coded), it is a sign you should extract that data from
  your database into a code-layer model.

- Never use numbered variable names (eg `account1 = ...`) -- there's always a
  better way.

On good things I always tell team members about:

- The writing and conference talks by James Mickens are great - start with
  ["Computers are a sadness, I am the cure"](https://vimeo.com/95066828) from
  Monitorama 2014.

- Have you seen [Tim Pope](https://twitter.com/tpope)'s
  [superb launch video](https://vimeo.com/63116209) for vim-dispatch (must be
  watched with sound)?

- Jack Diderich's
  ["Stop Writing Classes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0) PyCon
  2012 talk.

- The
  [DestroyAllSoftware screencasts](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts),
  especially
  ["Functional core, imperative shell"](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell).

On blogging:

- One of the best things about writing in markdown is you can have comments
  using the HTML `<!-- -->` comment syntax.

On working habits to try:

- Try typing with the keyboard on your lap.

- Try typing with your eyes closed. I find I'm more accurate that way as there's
  only one feedback steam (your fingers) rather than two (eyes and fingers).

- Try listening to [rain.today](https://rain.today) while working.
