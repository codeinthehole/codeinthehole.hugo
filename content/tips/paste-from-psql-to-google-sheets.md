I often need to grab information from a Postgres database and paste it
into a spreadsheet for sharing with others. Google Sheets needs the
pasted data to be tab-separated in order to be correctly split into
columns. This isn't the default behaviour for psql but here's how to
configure psql's output to get it.

At a psql prompt, switch to unaligned output

```postgres
=> \a
```

set the field separator to a tab character:

```postgres
=> \f '\t'
```

and turn the pager off:

```postgres
=> \pset pager off
```

then the output from subsequent `SELECT ...` statements can be cleanly
pasted into your Google Doc.
