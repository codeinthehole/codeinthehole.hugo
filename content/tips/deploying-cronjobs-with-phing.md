Deploying applications that depend on cron-jobs can be a pain. However,
Phing can be used to make such deployments easy - here's how...

Consider an application folder structure as follows:

``` bash
/builds
    /development
    /test
    /stage
/src
    /cron.d
        appname-__BUILD__-order-processing
    /scripts
        /order-processing
            handle-ready-to-ship-orders.php
            handle-cancellations.php
            ...
    /public
    /classes
        ...
```

All development work takes place within the `/src` folder while the
`/builds/*` folders are used as targets in deployment. This system
allows multiple builds to happily co-exist on the same server and the
whole application infrastructure to be moved between servers easily as
the structure in source control mirrors that of the server.

In this example e-commerce app, we have a number of scripts (in
`/src/scripts`) that handle order-processing which need to be called
periodically by the cron daemon. A naive approach in deployment would be
to export the codebase to an appropriate build folder but then edit the
server's crontab by hand and add the appropriate lines to run these
scripts.

This isn't such a great idea though as it relies on that most unreliable
facility, human memory, to ensure the build is fully deployed - this
creates an unnecessary overhead which is bound to lead to mistakes.
Furthermore, the overhead acts as a deterrent for using asynchronous
jobs within an application, limiting the app in terms of what it can do.
As far as I am aware, there is no easy way to automatically update a
user's crontab automatically.

A much better way is to create a number of scripts which specify the
cron tasks and are deployed to the /etc/cron.d folder. In the above
example, these are stored in /src/cron.d and would look something like:

``` bash
15 * * * *   root   /var/www/ecommerce.com/builds/__BUILD__/scripts/handle-ready-to-ship-orders.php > /dev/null 2>> /var/log/cron.errors.log
35 * * * *   root   /var/www/ecommerce.com/builds/__BUILD__/scripts/handle-cancellations.php > /dev/null 2>> /var/log/cron.errors.log
```

(Note that, for some reason, a blank line is required at the end of this
file in order for the script to be run by cron.) Here, the `__BUILD__`
is a tokenised parameter which will be replaced during deployment to
configure the path to the appropriate script - a phing trick I've
described previously.

One further complication is that if both the dev, test and stage builds
are running on the same server, then the scripts deployed to
`/etc/cron.d` could clobber each other as they have the same name within
each build. This can be neatly side-stepped using the Phing's glob
mapper to replace the `__BUILD__` component of the file to be the
appropriate build name (similar to how the paths are configured within
the file itself).

This is probably best illustrated with a sample phing script which takes
the build name (eg "development") as a parameter:

``` xml
<xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project>
    <target name="deploy">
        ...
        <delete>
            <fileset dir="/etc/cron.d/">
                <include name="appname-${build.name}-*" />
            </fileset>
        </delete>
        <copy todir="/etc/cron.d/"> 
            <filterchain>
                <replacetokens begintoken="__" endtoken="__">
                    <token key="BUILD" value="${build.name}" />
                </replacetokens>
            </filterchain>
            <mapper type="glob" from="appname-__BUILD__-*" to="appname-${build.name}-*" />
            <fileset dir="${path.to.build}/cron.d">
                <include name="appname-__BUILD__-*" />
            </fileset>
        </copy>
    </target>
</project>
```

The illustrated snippet does two things:

Deletes any previous scripts for this build from `/etc/cron.d` (this is
why we namespace the files with "appname" to prevent accidentally
removing a system file). Copies the new scripts into `/etc/cron.d` while
replacing the token `__BUILD__` with the build name in both the file
contents and file names. After separate deployments for dev and stage,
we should find the following:

``` bash
/etc
    /cron.d
        appname-development-order-processing
        appname-stage-order-processing
        ...
```

where, for instance, the contents of
`/etc/cron.d/appname-development-order-processing` would be:

``` bash
* * * * *   root   /var/www/ecommerce.com/builds/development/scripts/handle-ready-to-ship-orders.php
* * * * *   root   /var/www/ecommerce.com/builds/development/scripts/handle-cancellations.php
...
```

Having automatic and reliable deployment of cron-jobs in place is quite
liberating. Suddenly, lots of application processing can be done
asynchronously without worrying about the overhead of maintaining the
appropriate crontabs by hand.
