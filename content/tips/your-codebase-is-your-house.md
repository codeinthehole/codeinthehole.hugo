This is the best metaphor I know for promoting or defending software quality.

We do live in our codebases: shoddy software engineering has direct,
easily-visualised analogues from construction and house maintenance.

For instance, I'm sure you've seen these pull requests before[^1]:

Furthermore, the episode
["Hurrican Neddy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Neddy) from season 8
of The Simpsons is a parable of a failed software project, where feature
delivery is prioritised at the expense of maintainability.

I often think of the toilet in the kitchen often when reviewing code, when an
issue is addressed by shoving code into a place where it really doesn't belong.

It's a useful metaphor - it will serve you well in the struggle to keep a large
codebase maintainable[^2].
