}

Here's a few tips for using a [Git pre-commit
hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

### Keep your hook script in source control

Commit your hook script (say `pre-commit.sh`) at the root of your
project and include the installation instructions in your
README/documentation to encourage all developers use it.

Installation is nothing more than:

``` bash
ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Then everyone benefits from running the same set of tests before
committing and updates are picked up automatically.

### Stash unstaged changes before running tests

Ensure that code that isn't part of the prospective commit isn't tested
within your pre-commit script. This is missed by many sample pre-commit
scripts but is easily achieved with `git stash`:

``` bash
# pre-commit.sh
STASH_NAME="pre-commit-$(date +%s)"
git stash save -q --keep-index $STASH_NAME

# Test prospective commit
...

STASHES=$(git stash list)
if [[ $STASHES == "$STASH_NAME" ]]; then
  git stash pop -q
fi
```

The `-q` flags specify quiet mode.

### Run your test suite before each commit

Obviously.

It's best to have a script (say `run_tests.sh`) that encapsulates the
standard arguments to your test runner so your pre-commit script doesn't
fall out of date. Something like:

``` bash
# pre-commit.sh
git stash -q --keep-index
./run_tests.sh
RESULT=$?
git stash pop -q
[ $RESULT -ne 0 ] && exit 1
exit 0
```

where a sample `run_tests.sh` implementation for a Django project may
look like:

``` python
# run_tests.sh
./manage.py test --settings=settings_test -v 2
```

### Skip the pre-commit hook sometimes

Be aware of the `--no-verify` option to `git commit`. This bypasses the
pre-commit hook when committing, which is useful if you have just
manually run your test suite and don't need to see it run again when
committing.

I use git aliases to make this easy:

``` bash
# ~/.bash_aliases
alias gc='git commit'
alias gcv='git commit --no-verify'
```

### Search yo.. code for debugging code

At some point, someone will try and commit a file containing

``` bash
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

or some other debugging code. This can be easily avoided using the
`pre-commit.sh` file to grep the staged codebase and abort the commit if
forbidden strings are found.

Here's an example that looks for `console.log`:

``` bash
FILES_PATTERN='\.(js|coffee)(\..+)?$'
FORBIDDEN='console.log'
git diff --cached --name-only | \
    grep -E $FILES_PATTERN | \
    GREP_COLOR='4;5;37;41' xargs grep --color --with-filename -n $FORBIDDEN && echo 'COMMIT REJECTED Found "$FORBIDDEN" references. Please remove them before commiting' && exit 1
```

It's straightforward to extend this code block to search for other
terms.
