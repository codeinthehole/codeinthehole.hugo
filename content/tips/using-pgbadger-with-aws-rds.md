There's two non-obvious things to know when starting to use
[pgbadger](http://dalibo.github.io/pgbadger/) with AWS
RDS.

First, set:

```ini
log_statement = None 
```

Don't set this to _all_ as the [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.html) suggest.

Further, don't waste your time trying to add a DB parameter to set `log_line_prefix`
to pgbadger's recommended value: it's not possible[^1]. Instead tell
pgbadger about the log format that RDS insists on:

```bash
pgbadger -f stderr -p '%t:%r:%u@%d:[%p]:' postgres.log
```

Hope that saves you some time. Note that the `-f stderr` is required for
pgbadger v10 and above[^2]:
