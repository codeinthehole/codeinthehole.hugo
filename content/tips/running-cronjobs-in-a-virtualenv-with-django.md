If you use virtual environments on your django servers, then getting
manage.py commands to run from cron is a little tricky. You need to
activate the virtualenv before running the command and so you might
think that the following would work:

``` bash
*/10 * * * * root source /var/www/mysite/virtualenvs/dev/bin/activate && /var/www/mysite/build/dev/manage.py some_custom_command > /dev/null
```

It doesn't, although it's tricky to spot why as `/var/log/syslog`
doesn't give much away (Debian-specific of course).

A good trick for cronjob debugging is to alias yourself as root within
`/etc/aliases`:

``` bash
postmaster: root
root: yourusername@gmail.com
```

and run `sendmail -bi` to initialise the aliases. As errors from
cronjobs are emailed to root, you will also get a copy. Doing this
reveals the above cron file fails as the default shell for cron is
`/bin/sh` which doesn't support the source command.

The solution is to set the \$SHELL variable within the cron file:

``` bash
SHELL=/bin/bash
*/10 * * * * root source /var/www/mysite/virtualenvs/dev/bin/activate && /var/www/mysite/build/dev/manage.py some_custom_command > /dev/null
```

Update - have been informed of a much simpler technique that works for
most cases: simply run manage.py using the python executable of your
virtualenv:

``` bash
*/10 * * * * root /var/www/mysite/virtualenvs/dev/bin/python /var/www/mysite/build/dev/manage.py some_custom_command > /dev/null
```

I didn't spot this one to start with as our settings configuration
required a environmental variable to be used to indicate which settings
file to use. This variable was set within the activate script, hence why
the source command was needed. It turns out that this can just be set in
the cron file too:

``` bash
DJANGO_CONF=conf.dev
*/10 * * * * root /var/www/mysite/virtualenvs/dev/bin/python /var/www/mysite/build/dev/manage.py some_custom_command > /dev/null
```

Much simpler!
