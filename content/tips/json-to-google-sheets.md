Like many people, I use Google Sheets to quickly create and share tabular data. As well as
[creating spreadsheets by pasting results generated in `psql`](/tips/copying-postgres-output-into-a-spreadsheet/),
I often create reports from JSON files using
[JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). This post is a note-to-self on how to do
this.

Here's a command to create a tab-separated report from a JSON events file exported from
Loggly:

``` bash
$ cat loggly_events.json | \ 
    jq -r '.events[].event.json | 
           select(.params | has("payment_day")) | 
           [.timestamp, .account, .params.payment_day] | 
           @tsv' | clipboard
```

Note:

- The `-r` option instructs JQ to output raw strings, not quoted JSON strings.

- `@tsv` is a JQ format string for [outputting tab-separated values](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Formatstringsandescaping).

- The `clipboard` command is an alias for `pbcopy`, the system clipboard on
  OS-X.
