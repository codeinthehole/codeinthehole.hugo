### Problem

You want to add i18n support to an existing project. One part of this is
modifying all templates to use the `{% trans "..." %}` block around all
hard-coded strings.

When you have a lot of templates, this gets pretty tedious.

### Solution

Use Vim macros!

#### Macro 1 - Convert tag text

To convert

``` html
<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
```

to

``` html
<h1>{% trans "Welcome to my site" %}</h1>
```

use the macro

``` vim
vitc{% trans "" %}<ESC>4hp
```

which breaks down as:

- `vit` - select content inside the tag;
- `c{% trans "" %}` - change tag content to be `{% trans "" %}` while
    saving the original tag content to the anonymous register;
- `<ESC>4hp` - move the cursor to the first speech mark and paste the
    original tag contents. Note that `<ESC>` is one key-stroke, not
    five.

To record the macro, locate the cursor over a tag that you want to
convert then start recording by pressing `q` twice (to record the macro
to the named register `q`). Then type the characters detailed above and
press `q` again to stop recording.

To apply the macro, again locate the cursor over a tag, or the text it
contains, and type `@q`. This will save you a lot of key-strokes.

#### Macro 2 - Convert selected text

To convert

``` html
<p>See this image: <img src="/images/1.jpg" /> </p>
```

to

``` html
<p>{% trans "See this image:" %} <img src="/images/1.jpg" /> </p>
```

enter visual mode and select the text to convert (eg "See this image:")
then use the macro

``` vim
c{% trans "" %}<ESC>4hp
```

which is the same as the one above but without the tag text selection.

To summarise: Vim's macros are great - learn how to use them.
