Every now and again, an innocent python developer checks out a new git branch
then proceeds to bang their head against a bug caused by an orphaned `.pyc` file
from the previous branch. Since `*.pyc` files are typically in the repo's
`.gitignore` file, they are not removed when switching branches and can cause
issues if the corresponding `.py` is removed.

This can be neatly addressed through a 'post checkout' hook which deletes all
such files. Here is such a script, which also removes empty folders and prints a
summary:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Delete .pyc files and empty directories from root of project
cd ./$(git rev-parse --show-cdup)

# Clean-up
find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete

NUM_PYC_FILES=$( find . -name "*.pyc" | wc -l | tr -d ' ' )
if [ $NUM_PYC_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
    find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
    printf "\e[00;31mDeleted $NUM_PYC_FILES .pyc files\e[00m\n"
fi

NUM_EMPTY_DIRS=$( find . -type d -empty | wc -l | tr -d ' ' )
if [ $NUM_EMPTY_DIRS -gt 0 ]; then
    find . -type d -empty -delete
    printf "\e[00;31mDeleted $NUM_EMPTY_DIRS empty directories\e[00m\n"
fi
```
