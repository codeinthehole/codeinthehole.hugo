A client site went down today. This is what happened and how it was fixed.

### Symptoms

The immediate symptom is that your application servers can't connect to your
database servers. Attempted connections get an error message:

> Can't connect to MySQL server on '10.10.110.11' (111)

The relevant MySQL process list reveals a long list of attempted connections in
state `login`:

```bash
root@server-db1:~ $ mysqladmin processlist
+-----+----------------------+--------------------+----+---------+------+-------+
| Id  | User                 | Host               | db | Command | Time | State |
+-----+----------------------+--------------------+----+---------+------+-------+
...
| 261 | unauthenticated user | 10.20.115.19:43381 |    | Connect |      | login |
| 262 | unauthenticated user | 10.20.115.19:43396 |    | Connect |      | login |
| 263 | unauthenticated user | 10.20.115.19:43420 |    | Connect |      | login |
| 264 | unauthenticated user | 10.20.115.19:43429 |    | Connect |      | login |
| 265 | unauthenticated user | 10.20.115.4:55297  |    | Connect |      | login |
...
```

Your site is probably down as no request can connect to the database - people
are starting to get upset.

### Problem

When a client connects to MySQL, the newly spawned thread attempts to resolve
the host name (see
[MySQL's documentation on DNS](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/dns.html)).
This problem is caused by the first name server in `/etc/resolv.conf` being
down, causing the DNS request to time-out. Hence, every connection to MySQL sits
for a minute waiting for the timeout to occur. Within a few seconds, no client
will be able to connect.

You can verify this using the `dig` command to exercise the name servers in
`/etc/resolv.conf`. Here's the broken one (you'll have to wait for the
time-out):

```bash
dig @180.179.39.80 www.google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.7.0-P1 <<>> @180.179.39.80 www.google.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
```

A working name server would return something like:

```bash
dig @180.179.39.81 www.google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.7.0-P1 <<>> @180.179.39.81 www.google.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd

### Solution

The root solution is to fix the name server, but sometimes that isn't in your
control.

You can work around the borked name server by restarting MySQL with the
`--skip-name-resolve` option. This prevents MySQL trying to resolve the host
name for each thread, bypassing the name server problem.

Alternatively, you can remove the broken DNS server from your
`/etc/resolv.conf`.

### Discussion

Note that running MySQL with `--skip-name-resolve` means you can't use hostnames
in your privileges table. Thus, you may have to reconfigure your client users to
get your site back up. You can verify this by using the following SQL to inspect
your configured users and hosts:

```sql
mysql> SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```

Check to see if the `host` column uses domain names.
