Ever wanted to use `mysqldump` to dump tables that match a wildcard pattern? I
have. It's not currently supported as an option but can be achieved with a
little bash magic. Here's how:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -lt 2 ]
then
    echo "Usage: `basename $0` database wildcardpattern"
    echo "Eg: `basename $0` mydatabase App_%"
    exit 1
fi
database=$1
pattern=$2
mysqldump $database `mysql -ND $database -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE '$pattern'" | awk '{printf $1" "}'`
```

This uses a simple SQL query to extract all the table names that match the
pattern and concatenate them in the format that mysqldump expects. Note that
you'll need your `~/.my.cnf` set up correctly to allow the connections to MySQL
to happen without a authentication prompt.
