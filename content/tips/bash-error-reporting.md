Two tips:

## Fail fast

You probably already know that you can force Bash scripts to exit immediately if
there's an error (that is, if any command exits with a non-zero exit code) using:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
```

but it's even better to use:

```bash
set -eu -o pipefail
```

so that the script:

- exits on an error (`-e`, equivalent to `-o errexit`);
- exits on an undefined variable (`-u`, equivalent to `-o nounset`);
- exits on an error in piped-together commands (`-o pipefail`)[^pgdump].

You can learn more about these built-ins with:

```bash
help set
```

## Fail noisy

Failing fast is all very well but, by default scripts fail silently offering
no debug information.

You can add:

```bash
set -x
```

to print each command before execution but it's easy to add simple error
handling using `trap`:.

```bash
function print_error {
    read line file <<<$(caller)
    echo "An error occurred in line $line of file $file:" >&2
    sed "${line}q;d" "$file" >&2
}
trap print_error ERR
```

Here we bind the `print_error` function to the `ERR` event and print out an
error message and offending line of the script (extracted using `sed`) to
STDERR.

Note the use of a `<<<` _here string_ and the `caller` built-in to
assign the line and filename of the error.

So running the script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu -o pipefail

function print_error {
    read line file <<<$(caller)
    echo "An error occurred in line $line of file $file:" >&2
    sed "${line}q;d" "$file" >&2
}
trap print_error ERR

false
```

gives:

```bash
$ ./script.sh
An error occurred in line 11 of file ./test.sh:
false
```

There are more sophisticated ways to handle errors in Bash scripts[^othertools] but
this is a concise, simple option to have to hand.

[^pgdump]: Without this `pg_dump ... | gzip` would not be treated as an error even if `pg_dump` exited with a non-zero exit code.
[^othertools]: See the [Bash infinity framework](https://invent.life/project/bash-infinity-framework) for example.
