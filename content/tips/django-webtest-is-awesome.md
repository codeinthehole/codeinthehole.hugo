Since watching Carl Meyer's superb '[Testing and
Django](http://pyvideo.org/video/699/testing-and-django)' talk, I've
been using Ian Bicking's
[WebTest](http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/en/latest/index.html) library
for functional tests, via
[django-webtest](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-webtest). I've been
really impressed and I'd like to stress one of Carl's points - that
using WebTest for functional tests is superior to using the Django
client.

### Why?

Several reasons - here's a few:

- WebTest allows you to model a user's experience much more closely as
    it is smart about mark-up. Instead of hand-crafting GET and POST
    requests, you can use the WebTest API to follow links and submit
    forms - this is what users actually do. As a result, your tests
    accurately capture user stories.
- A corollary to the last point is that writing functional tests with
    WebTest is both easier and quicker than using Django's test client.
    It's much simpler to fill in forms that construct complicated arrays
    of POST data - this is particularly noticable with formsets.
- The WebTest response object supports [several ways of parsing the
    response
    HTML](http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/en/latest/index.html#parsing-the-body),
    making it easy to make complicated assertions about the response.

Watch from 29:48 in Carl's talk for further details.

### Example functional test

Consider this story from a functional spec:

> A staff member can upload a CSV to create new credit allocations for
> customers.

Here's a WebTest for this:

``` python
from django_webtest import WebTest
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django_dynamic_fixture import G

from myproject.credits import api


class TestAnAdmin(WebTest):

    def setUp(self):
        self.staff = G(User, is_staff=True)
        self.customer = G(User, username='10000', is_staff=False)

    def test_can_upload_a_csv_to_create_allocations(self):
        index = self.app.get(reverse('credits-index'), user=staff)

        # Specify the file content to upload and submit the form
        form = index.forms['upload_form']
        # CSV content should be: username, credits, start_date, end_date
        content = "10000,250,2012-01-01,2013-01-01"
        form['file'] = 'credits.csv', content
        form.submit()

        # Check that an allocation has been created
        self.assertEqual(250, api.balance(customer))
        self.assertEqual(1, api.allocations(customer).count())
```

As you can see, using WebTest allows the story to be captured in a
simple and readable test. This is based on a real functional test from a
current project of mine. Writing the above test took about 2 minutes.

#### Other useful testing libraries

The example test uses
[django\_dynamic\_fixture](http://paulocheque.github.com/django-dynamic-fixture/)
to create users, specifying only the attributes relevant to the test.

Note also the mildly unusual naming convention of the example TestCase
and method are because I use
[django\_nose](https://github.com/jbalogh/django-nose) with the 'spec'
plugin from the
[pinocchio](http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/pinocchio/doc/) library.
This causes the nose output to read like the stories from your
functional spec:

``` bash
$ ./manage.py test tests/functional/eshop/credits_tests.py

nosetests --verbosity 1 tests/functional/eshop/credits_tests.py --with-spec -x -s

An admin
- can upload a csv to create allocations

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 tests in 0.269s
```

This is a useful way of running functional tests. It also pushes you
towards splitting your tests suites into more carefully named,
tightly-focussed test cases - rather than bundling disparate tests into
the same test case.

### Summary

Use WebTest for your functional tests - you won't regret it.
