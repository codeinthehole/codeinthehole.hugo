Good technical talks that I can refer people to.

Misc:

- **[Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366)** by _Brett
  Victor_.<br/> An inspiring talk demonstrating new UI concepts for creation.

All talks (and articles) by James Mickens are essential:

- **[Computers are a Sadness, I am the Cure](https://vimeo.com/36579366)** by
  _James Mickens_.<br/> "Say word count one more time..."
