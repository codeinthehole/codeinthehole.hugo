I am totally reliant on my bash aliases and readline configuration. When
working on a new server, the first thing I do is copy over my local Bash
(`~/.bashrc`) and Readline (`~/.inputrc`) configuration files.

One mildly annoying issue is when you update a config file, it's a pain
to copy it onto all your remote hosts. To scratch this itch, I wrote a
simple node.js executable for copying a file to all the defined hosts in
your `~/.ssh/config` file

Usage is trivial:

``` bash
$ multi-scp ~/.bashrc
Starting sync of '~/.bashrc' to all hosts in /home/david/.ssh/config
-> Copying to mars
-> Copying to venus
-> Copying to jupiter
<- Successful copy to mars
<- Successful copy to venus
<- Successful copy to jupiter
```

Using node.js seems an odd choice as this could trivially be done in
another scripting language. However, I wanted to use node as:

- it allows the copy operation to run asynchronously in a child
    process with a callback to handle completion and error;
- it's fashionable.

The [code is on Github](https://github.com/codeinthehole/node-multi-scp)
as usual.
