Working with URLs in Python feels clunky when it should be pleasant. In
[urlparse](http://docs.python.org/library/urlparse.html) and
[urllib](http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html), the standard
library has all the functionality you need, but the code you have to
write is often cumbersome and unclear.

For instance, here's a typical test method that makes an assertion about
a query parameter:

``` python
import urlparse

def test_url_has_correct_query_parameter(self):
    url = get_url_from_somewhere()
    parse_result = urlparse.parseurl(url)
    query_params = urlparse.parse_qs(parse_result.query)
    self.assertEqual('testing', query_params['q'][0])
```

Not terrible, but could be more concise. I would prefer something like:

``` python
from somelibrary import URL

def test_url_has_correct_query_parameter(self):
    url = URL.from_string(get_url_from_somewhere())
    self.assertEqual('testing', url.query_param('q'))
```

Further, when working with webservices, you often need to build URLs
programmatically but it just isn't easy enough in python. You often end
up using string formatting:

``` python
import urllib

URL_TEMPLATE = 'https://github.com/%s?w=%s' 
def get_github_url(username):
    return URL_TEMPLATE % (urllib.quote(username), '0')
```

A preferable API might look something like:

``` python
from somelibrary import URL

BASE_URL = URL.from_string('https://github.com/') 
def get_github_url(username):
    return BASE_URL.path_segment(0, username).query_param('w', 0)
```

This is a toy example, the problem is much worse when building more
complicated URLs.

### purl

<div class="admonition warning">
    Warning - the code examples below are from version 0.2 of purl - please
    consult the <a href="https://github.com/codeinthehole/purl">Github documentation</a> for the latest
    reference.
</div>

So I wrote a utility class to scratch this itch. It's a simple immutable
`URL` class that uses jQuery-style overloading of the attribute methods
to be both accessors and mutators.

Install with:

``` python
pip install purl
```

Construct URL instances as follows:

``` python
from purl import URL

# Explicit constructor
u = URL(scheme='https', host='www.google.com', path='/search', query='q=testing')

# Use factory class-method
u = URL.from_string('https://www.google.com/search?q=testing')

# Chain mutator methods (which each return a new instance)
u = URL().scheme('https').host('www.google.com').path('search').query_param('q', 'testing')

# Combine to suit your use-case
u = URL.from_string('https://www.google.com').path('search') \
                                             .query_param('q', 'testing')
```

There's a full range of inspection methods:

``` python
# Simple attributes
u.scheme()      # 'https'
u.host()        # 'www.google.com' 
u.domain()      # 'www.google.com' - alias of host
u.port()        # None (only returns something if explicitly set)
u.path()        # '/search'
u.query()       # 'q=testing'
u.fragment()    # ''

# Convenience methods for inspecing path, query and host
u.path_segment(0)                   # 'search'
u.path_segments()                   # ('search',)
u.query_param('q')                  # 'testing'
u.query_param('q', as_list=True)    # ['testing']
u.query_param('lang', default='GB') # 'GB'
u.query_params()                    # {'q': 'testing'}
u.has_query_param('q')              # True
u.subdomains()                       # ['www', 'google', 'com']
u.subdomain(0)                       # 'www'
```

Each accessor method is overloaded to be a mutator method too, similar
to the jQuery API. Since the URL class is immutable, any mutation will
return a new URL instance.

``` python
u = URL.from_string('https://github.com/codeinthehole')

# Access
u.path_segment(0) # returns 'codeinthehole'

# Mutate (creates a new instance)
new_url = u.path_segment(0, 'tangentlabs') # returns new URL object
```

Here's a fancier example of building a URL:

``` python
u = URL().scheme('https')\
         .host('github.com')`\
         .path_segment(0, 'codeinthehole')\
         .path_segment(1, 'purl')\
print u.as_string()

# returns 'https://github.com/codeinthehole/purl'
```

### Alternatives

There are a couple of URL classes already for python - however neither
had the exact API I was looking for.

- [mxURL](http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/mxURL/) - Part
    of the 'eGenix.com mx Base Distribution', this has quite a
    comprehensie API. It comes bundles with other utility modules with
    the 'egenix-mx-base' package.
- [URLObject](https://github.com/zacharyvoase/urlobject/) - There's
    nothing wrong with this implementation - it's very similar to my one
    above. The API's not quite to my tastes but that's purely subjective
    thing.
