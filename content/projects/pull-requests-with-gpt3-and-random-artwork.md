<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

A friend of mine has been retweeting great paintings from Twitter accounts like
[`@HenryRothwell`][twitter_rothwell], which I've greatly enjoyed. E.g.

In a similar vein, I've started embedding painting images in the description of
every pull request I open. E.g.

<!-- CONTENT -->

I create pull requests with:

```sh
git createpr
```

where `createpr` is an alias to [`hub pull-request`][hub] with pre-populated
options:

```dosini
# ~/.gitconfig

createpr = !hub pull-request --draft --browse --edit
    --message=\"$(pull-request-title)\"
    --message=\"$(pull-request-summary)\"
    --message=\"$(random-picture)\"
```

The pull request body is built by joining the `--message` options separated by a
blank line. Each message component has its own script:

- `pull-request-title` is a [Bash script][gist_pr_title] that uses the OpenAI
  API to summarise the commit messages into a pull request title. I haven't
  quite found the right prompt text to work here — that's a work-in-progress.

- `pull-request-summary` is a simple [Python script][gist_pr_body] that combines
  all the commit messages and removes the hard line wrapping[^1]. The output
  will generally need some editing before it's suitable (hence the `--edit`
  option in the alias) but it's a good starting point.

- `random-picture` is a [Python script][repo_random_picture] that plucks a
  randomly selected image from a set of Twitter accounts and prints the
  appropriate markdown.

This works nicely — the painting images even unfurl elegantly in Slack.

[^1]:
    Commit messages are hard-wrapped at 72 characters but pull request
    descriptions shouldn't be hard wrapped.
